# Thermocouple MCP9600

This example project integrates the MCP9600 as a CAN device. 

You'll need to add some dependancies:
- https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MCP9600/releases/tag/2.0.4
- https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO/releases/tag/1.17.2

These can be installed via PlatformIO or by manually downloading the zips. The unzipped directorys will need placing in the "lib" folder. Make sure they don't have nested folders, which can happen when unzipping.
